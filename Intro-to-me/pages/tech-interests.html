    Since I was young, I've had a fascination with technology, it's always been my dream to work with technology, and now my dreams are starting to come to fruition. Since using Web 105, my knowledge of how the internet works has expanded so much. I've also taken another programming class, and that class has made me enjoy programming, so much so that I cannot wait until I'm working and making programs. I enjoy watching YouTube videos about future technology or other types of technology I didnâ€™t know about previously. I also like to look in the news for any new upcoming technology, just to see what it is.
